Construction
Welcome to Construction, a solo PET project crafted from inception to a fully realized final product. This endeavor consumed approximately 40 hours of dedicated work, showcasing a tech stack featuring HTML, CSS, React.js, TypeScript, and Redux.

The project provided an excellent opportunity to delve into the intricacies of sliders, animations, images, videos, and other fascinating processes. The design, while not extravagantly exclusive, leans towards a foundational minimalism. Form validation leveraged Formik and Yup for a seamless experience.

All sliders were meticulously crafted using the react-slick library. SVG images were imported as TSX elements, adding a touch of sophistication. Backend simulation was achieved through straightforward JSON files.

Implementing this project proved to be both challenging and engrossing, pushing the boundaries of knowledge and skills. Exploring new libraries and possibilities became a rewarding aspect of the journey.

For those curious, the design mockup can be accessed here.
